# Eat The Stake
Staking DApp for [Eat The Blocks Projects #2](https://github.com/jklepatch/eattheblocks/tree/master/etb-projects/project2-staking).

![screenshot](screenshot.png)

## Install
1. Install truffle/contract dependencies:
```
yarn install
```
2. Install client:
```
cd client
yarn install
```

## Unit tests
```
truffle test
```

## Run
1. Run ganache:
```
ganache-cli
```
2. Deploy contracts:
```
truffle migrate --reset
```
3. Start front end:
```
cd client
yarn start
```
4. If you'd like to pass 15 days in your Ganache blockchain, execute the following 2 lines at truffle console:
```
timestamp = (await web3.eth.getBlock(await await web3.eth.getBlockNumber()))['timestamp']
advancetime = new Promise((resolve,reject) => { web3.currentProvider.send({jsonrpc:'2.0', method: 'evm_mine', params: [timestamp+60*60*24*15], id: timestamp}, (err, result) => { if (err) { return reject(err) } return resolve(result); }) })
```

## Known issues/limitations
- The DApp was designed for ETB token and Pancakeswap LP tokens. So it only supports 18 decimal tokens, and no support for tokens with fee on transfer and other esoterica.
- For some reason, when running the unit tests, truffle takes around 1:30 minutes before it even reaches the initial compilation stage. I'm not sure if it's a local error or something with Truffle. Anyway, this does not happen when running deployment.
- In the truffle tests it is tricky to test for balances, as we are calculating based on seconds and sometimes there is 1-3 seconds of delay. [See here Gotacha#2](https://medium.com/fluidity/standing-the-time-of-test-b906fcc374a9) for explanation. To combat this, when testing time sensitive functions, I allow the actual result to be within 3 (monetary unit allocated per second) error of margin from the expected result.
- client/src/contracts (truffle build directory) is committed to the repository for the CI workflow.

## Misc
- The contract is based upon SushiSwap's MasterChef.
- In the development network, the contract deploys 2 mock ERC20 contracts and mints tokens for the first Ganache accounts, for testing. The first account will be the owner who is allowed to add rewards, and the next 2 accounts can be used for staking and testing. These contracts (ERC20Factory and MockERC20) will not be deployed to networks other than local dev networks.

Audit file: [Audit file](audit/ce997d5316543b369ede443c.pdf)

## CI
Ci script located at `.github/workflows/build.yaml`
The script test whole project `backend` and `client` on different node versions.   
Test deployment - installing necessary packages including `ganache-cli` and deploy the project to `development` local ganache network while the contract artifact's 
stored to `client/src/contracts` directory.
If that succeeds, basic client coverage tests  is triggered.
